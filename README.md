### Why This Structure?
- The GitHub README should make a strong first impression; it should be clear what the project does, how it works, and how to set it up: contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Code snippets and visual integration enhance the user experience.
- The backend architecture and data flow are clearly defined.
- The purpose of the demo is clearly stated, preventing misunderstandings.

You can use this README.md file directly or customize it to your own repo structure. I can also help you add custom folder structures, badges, or screenshot placeholders to your project!
